Hello, and welcome to `into_rust()`! This site consists of screencasts
showing tutorials that I have been working on for over a year. The
tutorials take an "Ownership First" approach -- which means that we
place a heavy emphasis on learning how ownership and the borrow
checker work, rather than covering Rust's syntax or other details. The
reason for this is othat ownership is Rust's most unique feature, and
is often the one that people find the most confusing.

The current set of tutorials is just a start. I hope to post
additional screencasts on a regular basis. Here are some of the talks
we have queued up:

- Structs and enums
- Threads
- Traits
- Named lifetime parameters
- Aliasing and mutability

The sources for `into_rust()` are [available in Github][gh] (as are,
in fact, [the Keynote slides] for a number of the tutorials mentioned
above). If you find errors or have suggestions for improvement, please
open an issue. If you'd be interested in helping in other ways, check
out the README or the open issues on the repository. (Among other
things, I am sure I did some rather embarassing things in the CSS or
other bits of this site. So please show me the right way to do it!)
